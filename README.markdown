[View my dotfiles on BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/)

For a while I've been maintaining a mirror of my dotfiles here on GitHub.

Unfortunately at some point, something shat the bed inside the giant Rube
Goldberg machine of hg-git and GitHub.  My life is too short to deal with this
bullshit, so I'm not maintaining this mirror any more.  You can still go look at
them on BitBucket.
